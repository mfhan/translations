			<p>Literary translation is, by nature, a subjective effort to interpret and represent a writer's artistic choices into another language. Word-for-word accuracy is neither required nor expected -- but fidelity to the overall meaning and emotional content is what determines a successful endeavor. </p> 
			<p>How emotionally faithful is a piece of translated text? Is there a consistent, accurate way to measure that dimension? Can sentiment analysis be a useful tool? Let's look at short, but emotionally and structurally significant passages from three novels from the Western canon. </p>

		<h3 class="subtitle">Les Misérables: the Death of Gavroche</h3>

		<p class="column">
			Unforgettable to anyone who's read the rousing final volume of Victor Hugo's protean novel -- and anybody's who's seen the long-running musical comedy, the death of street urchin Gavroche represents the culmination of myriad injustices and cruelties endured by the dispossessed. </p>
			<p>
			The insurgency has failed, and the small group of students retrenched behind their crumbling barricades know their fate is sealed. 
			Fast-talking, street-wise and intrepid Gavroche  ventures into the open, within shooting distance of the soldiers, in a desperate attempt to collect ammunition. He dances with death until, at last, he is hit by a sharpshooter's bullet. He continues to sing for a brief moment until a second bullet kills him.  
		</p>
		<p>The original French version and its English translation were carefully divided into 58 pieces of text, then analyzed by <i>twitter-XLM-roBERTa-base for Sentiment Analysis</i>, a multilingual model trained on almost 200 million tweets. </p>
		<p>The French original is on the left, and the English translation on the right. 
		Deep blue denotes a "positive" sentiment with a score of more than 0.5; light blue is "positive" with a score of less than 0.5; light gray is "neutral"; light red is a "negative" sentiment with a score of less than 0.5; and finally the deep red that dominates the French version means "negative" with a score of more than 0.5.

			No need to be bilingual to be struck by the vast differences in sentiment between the two versions. Out of 58 text elements,  the English translation has 26 neutrals and just 28 negatives, while the French original has 41 negative labels and just 12 neutrals to emphasize the tragedy of a dying child. </p>
			<p>The most striking discrepancy lies at the very end of the text, when a second bullet fatally strikes the wounded child:</p>
				<p><i>"This time he fell face downward on the pavement / and moved no more. / This grand little soul had taken its flight."</i></p>
				<p>While the French version gets a "negative" label for all three pieces of text, with scores ranging from 0.48 to 0.69, the English text gets: "neutral" with a 0.52 score, "neutral" with a 0.54 score, and a puzzling "positive" with a 0.47 score. 
			</p>
			<p>What could explain such a contrast? Could it be that the twitter-XLM-roBERTa-base model, trained on the syntax and content of tweets, could fail to correctly interpret a work of fiction full of metaphors and emotion? </p>

<h3 class="subtitle">Proust: The "Little Phrase"</h3>
			<p class="column">How will the model analyze another work famous for its depiction of complex human emotions: Marcel Proust's titanic "In Search of Lost Time" hexalogy. 
				In this passage, from "Swann's Way", the narrator's long-buried memories of a painful lost love are searingly, "maddeningly" awakened by a little musical phrase from a violin sonata.

		<p>Here again, the original French version and its English translation were divided into 40 pieces of text and analyzed by <i>twitter-XLM-roBERTa-base</i>. </p>
		<p>The French original is on the left, and the English translation on the right. 
		Again, deep blue denotes a "positive" sentiment with a score of more than 0.5; light blue is "positive" with a score of less than 0.5; light gray is "neutral"; light red is a "negative" sentiment with a score of less than 0.5; and deep red means "negative" with a score of more than 0.5.

			While the contrast is a bit less striking, it is undeniable that the original has more red bars of negative sentiment than the translation, which is dominated by neutrals.

			It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
			
			
			The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
