				<p>Literary translation is, by nature, a subjective effort to interpret and represent a writer's artistic
					choices
					into another language. Word-for-word accuracy is neither required nor expected -- but fidelity to the overall
					meaning and emotional content is what determines a successful endeavor. </p>
				<p>How emotionally faithful is a piece of translated text? Is there a consistent, accurate way to measure that
					dimension? Can sentiment analysis be a useful tool? Let's look at short, but emotionally and structurally
					significant passages from three novels from the Western canon. </p>

				<h3 class="subtitle">Les Misérables: the Death of Gavroche</h3>

				<p class="column">
					Anyone who's read the rousing final volume of Victor Hugo's protean novel -- and anybody's who's
					seen the long-running musical comedy -- knows that this is an epic full of tears, strife, suffering and
					salvation.
					Between the work houses, the prisons and the student riots, the body count is high and the wine flows.
					But even with this colorful backdrop, the death of street urchin Gavroche represents the culmination of all
					the injustices and cruelties endured by the dispossessed. </p>
				<p>
					The insurgency has failed, and the small group of students retrenched behind their crumbling barricades know
					that their fate is sealed.
					Fast-talking, street-wise and intrepid Gavroche ventures into the open, within shooting distance of the
					soldiers, in a desperate attempt to collect ammunition. He dances with death until, at last, he is hit by a
					marksman's bullet. He continues to sing for a brief moment until a second bullet kills him.
				</p>
				<p>The original French version and its English translation were carefully divided into 58 pieces of text, then
					analyzed by <i>twitter-XLM-roBERTa-base for Sentiment Analysis</i>, a multilingual model trained on almost 200
					million tweets. </p>
				<p>The French original is on the left, and the English translation on the right. Deep blue denotes a "positive"
					sentiment with a score of more than 0.5; light blue is "positive" with a score of less than 0.5; light gray is
					"neutral"; light red is a "negative" sentiment with a score of less than 0.5; and finally the deep red that
					dominates the French version means "negative" with a score of more than 0.5.

				No need to be bilingual to be struck by the vast differences in sentiment between the two versions. Out of 58
				text
				elements, the English translation has 26 neutrals and just 28 negatives, while the French original has 41
				negative
				labels and just 12 neutrals -- an unsurprising ration for a text that describes the death of a child. </p>
			<p>The most striking discrepancy lies at the very end of the text, when a second bullet fatally strikes the
				wounded
				boy:</p>
			<p><i>"This time he fell face downward on the pavement / and moved no more. / This grand little soul had taken its
					flight."</i></p>
			<p>While the French version gets a "negative" label for all three pieces of text, with scores ranging from 0.48 to
				0.69, the English text gets: "neutral" with a 0.52 score, "neutral" with a 0.54 score, and a puzzling "positive"
				with a 0.47 score.
			</p>
			<p>What could explain such a contrast? Could it be that the twitter-XLM-roBERTa-base model, trained on the syntax
				and content of 21st-century tweets, fails to correctly interpret a work of 19th century fiction full of
				metaphors and emotion? </p>
			<p>Another hypothesis: would it be possible that, by nature, translations tend to lean toward a more neutral
				version of the same phrases and ideas? </p>

		<div class="column">
			<h3 class="subtitle">Proust: The "Little Phrase"</h3>
			<p class="column">How will the model analyze another work famous for its depiction of complex human emotions:
				Marcel
				Proust's titanic "In Search of Lost Time" hexalogy.
				In this passage, from "Swann's Way", the narrator's long-buried memories of a painful lost love are searingly,
				"maddeningly" awakened by a little musical phrase from a violin sonata. Even the harshest pang of suffering is
				intimately connected with the residual joy of lost love.
			</p>
			<!-- </div> -->

			<p>Here again, the original French version and its English translation were divided into 40 pieces of text and
				analyzed by <i>twitter-XLM-roBERTa-base</i>. </p>
			<p>The French original is on the left, and the English translation on the right.
				Again, deep blue denotes a "positive" sentiment with a score of more than 0.5; light blue is "positive" with a
				score of less than 0.5; light gray is "neutral"; light red is a "negative" sentiment with a score of less than
				0.5; and deep red means "negative" with a score of more than 0.5.

				While the contrast is a bit less striking, it is undeniable that the original has more red bars of negative
				sentiment than the translation, which is dominated by neutrals.
			</p>
			<p>The French version starts briskly: the red bars in the first 10 lines illustrate the physical reaction to the
				sudden recollection ("and this apparition tore him with such anguish / that his hand rose impulsively to his
				heart"). After fluttering in a desperate attempt to stave off the flood of memories (blues and neutrals in the
				middle section), it finally gives way to their "maddening" song -- in a confusing mix of pain and joy. </p>
			<p>The model clearly finds the English version more neutral -- 23 of the 40 pieces, compared with only 9
				negatives.
				The French version gets 18 negatives and 14 neutrals. </p>

				Puzzling classifications: why does Roberta consider the final sentence a positive in french and a negative in English? Why xxxx? </p> -->
			<p>
			<p>still, puzzling labels abound: why is the phrase "wwhen Odette was in love with him" score a 0.6 negative in
				French, but a 0.65 neutral? And why is the model finding the final clause, "the forgotten strains of happiness",
				rate a negative 0.48 in English and a 0.66 positive in French? </p>
		</div>
		<div class="column">
			<h3 class="subtitle">Turning the Tables: Wuthering Heights</h3>
			<p class="column">For good measure, I decided to use the sentiment model on another emotionally-charged work of
				fiction: Wuthering Heights. In this scene, Heathcliff reappears after a three-year absence. Everything has
				changed -- his beloved Cathy is married to Edgar Linton, and Heathcliff himself is a grown, somber man bent on
				revenge. But when he sees her, their mutual delight consumes them.
			</p>
			<p>
				"They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy / to suffer embarrassment."
				"You don't deserve this welcome / to be absent and silent for three years / and never to think of me!"
				"I've fought through a bitter life / since I last heard your voice; / and you must forgive me, / for I struggled
				only for you!"
				In a bit more than 40 slices of text, there is joy, longing, anger and self-destruction. Will the French
				translation successfully
				convey this explosion of feelings, or will it water things down as we saw in our first two examples?

			<p>And yet again, a full half of the French text is negative, with just 11 neutrals and 10 positives. In the
				English text, neutral labels represent half of the rows, with 17 negatives to and just 4 positives. </p>
			<p>What can we conclude at this point is that, when it comes to literary translations, the Cardiff Roberta model
				finds French sentences more polarized than their English counterparts. </p>
			<p>Hugo, with his intentional digressions and infinite subplots, and Proust, with his spellbinding sentences, are
				equally challenging to translate. No surprise, then, that models trained on modern sentences have trouble
				labeling them consistently. Perhaps the most important observation to draw from these contrasting results is
				that sentiment analysis, as well as translation, remain deeply subjective as culturally-informed disciplines.
